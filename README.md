# deep_ptr : a pointer-class to enable copying of polymorphic types

`deep_ptr` allows compiler-generated copy, move, assignment and destruction to
behave correctly for objects with polymorphic components.

# Composite objects

Use of components in design of object-orientated class heirarchies is recommended as a 'good thing'.
Making components polymorphic allows great flexibility
